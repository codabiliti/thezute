            <h1>Community Guidelines</h1>
            <p>To keep our community safe, please follow these rules or your account will be terminated immediately. These guidelines are intended to keep people safe, protect members, keep ZUTE running, and to encourage personal responsibility for what you do on ZUTE.<br></p>
            <ol role="list">
              <li>No bullying: Hate speech targeted towards any group of people will be removed from our services. This includes hateful speech on the basis of gender, sexuality, race, religion and ethnicity. Don’t defame, impersonate, or abuse another person. We do not tolerate any type of bullying abuse, whether that’s emotional, mental and so on.<br></li>
            </ol>
            <ol start="2" role="list">
              <li>Do not use ZUTE to engage in or promote illegal behavior such as selling controlled substances or solicitation. If you solicit minors for any reason or post sexually explicit content of minors, we will suspend your account and report you to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. Do not make threats of violence; we may share your IP address, location, and other information with law enforcement if we think you have made a threat to the safety of others. We can be required by law to disclose your information if we receive a subpoena, court order, or search warrant.<br></li>

            <p>We actively moderate the service and ban users who violate these rules. We reserve the right to suspend accounts or remove content for violating these guidelines or for any reason, but particularly to protect our users and community.</p>
            <p>We treat references to self-harm and eating disorders seriously. Any posts glorifying these issues will be deleted. </p>
            <p>If you get questions that make you feel uncomfortable, please ignore them or report them to the system administrators. Please do not engage in conversations with people that make you feel uncomfortable in any way.<br></p>
